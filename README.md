# My Portfolio Website that I made for ISS Assignment 3

## This includes information about me, my birthplace, my non-existant skills and insignificant achievements along with a random text analyzer because it was in the question.

## Assumptions:
- Combined all of the things into 1 page because there was not much content to put if I did it on individual webpages. Also my webpage looked good as a single page and I didn't want to ruin it.
- Q2: clicks/views timestamp part is only visible in Console of the webpage (press F12 to open).
- The tokenization and letter count etc part (Q3) is merged into the Text Analyzer section.
- The Text Analyzer can "analyze" texts for number of words less than or equal to 10k as well as greater than 10k. (Even I don't know the upper limit. The site crashed when i went over 18 million words)
